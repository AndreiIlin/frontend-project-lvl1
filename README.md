## This is first hexlet project:

This project consist of 5 games:

1. Game: "Parity check";
2. Game: "Calculator";
3. Game: "Greatest common divisor";
4. Game: "Arithmetic Progression";
5. Game: "Is it a Prime Number?".

## Setup

Clone this repo to your desktop and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Game: "Parity check"

Rules: The user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if odd.

To start the game go to root directory and use `make brain-even` command.

Demo of game: https://asciinema.org/a/ii4fwx1cgqjXpHsM2y7s5l73R

## Game: "Calculator"

Rules: The user is shown a random mathematical expression that needs to be calculated and written down the correct answer.

To start the game go to root directory and use `make brain-calc` command.

## Game: "Greatest common divisor"

Rules: The user is shown two random numbers, he must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

To start the game go to root directory and use `make brain-gcd` command.

## Game: "Arithmetic Progression"

Rules: The user is shown a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression. One of the numbers is hidden by two dots, the user must define this number.

To start the game go to root directory and use `make brain-progression` command.

## Game: "Is it a Prime Number?"

Rules: The user is shown a number and needs to answer yes, if it is prime, or no, if otherwise.

To start the game go to root directory and use `make brain-prime` command.
